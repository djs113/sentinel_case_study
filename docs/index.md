# Sentinel: Night Patrolling for Kochi City Police

**Sentinel** is a mission-critical platform designed to enhance the operational efficiency of the Kochi City Police during night patrols. 

### The Problem
Urban security requires high-resolution, up-to-date tactical maps. Standard GIS pipelines estimated a **21-day render time** for the regional dataset, making daily updates impossible for police field units.

### The Engineering Solution
I architected a specialized **Geospatial ETL Engine** integrated into a **Temporal Computing** infrastructure. 

* **ETL Transformation:** Reduced map generation from 21 days to **10 minutes**.

* **Automation:** 100% "Zero-Touch" hardware orchestration.

* **Impact:** Police units receive fresh tactical data every morning at 3:00 AM without manual intervention.
